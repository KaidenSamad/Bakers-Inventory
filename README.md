# Bakers-Inventory
1st coding project for CS 100 class
This code works as an inventory tracker
The code will read in the number of bread, croissants, muffins, and cookies sold throughout the day, then will output how many of each item are needed to get back to the total number of bread, croissants, muffins, and cookies started with. With this information the code will output how much money is needed to buy back all of the bread, croissants, muffins, and cookies.
